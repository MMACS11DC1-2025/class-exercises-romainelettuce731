Mason's super awesome project :D

---How to use my project---
    Paste the code into trinket.io. After running the program, it will ask you how large you would like your tubes to start out as.
    It will then ask you for how many tubes you would like to generate. The user may input 2, 4, 6, or 8. 
    If this number is not 2, 4, 6, or 8, the program will ask the user to renter a valid number.
    The program will then generate the requested amount of tubes with a total amount of rings equal to double the size inputted. (If there are two tubes, total amount of rings are equal to size to keep pattern looking nice)
    Once the pattern has generated, the program will tell you the amount of recursions that happened.
    Run the program again to create a new pattern!

---Reasonable Recursion Depth Discussion---
    For my project, I stopped the recursion once the size reached 0. This is because allowing the size to go into the negatives would reverse the tube's direction and cause overlapping, creating a pattern that didn't look so good. There is no limit set for a number that may be too high because although the design is really large and takes a long time to draw, it can still create a nice design with enough time and the right sizes.

---Test Cases---
