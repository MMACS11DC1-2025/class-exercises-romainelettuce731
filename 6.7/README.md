--Project Theme--

My project will determine if the art shown is considered pixel art or not. It will scan the art provided and look for the number of unique colours to determine whether it has a wider array of colours due to being digital art/paint art or whether it is a simpler design created out of larger pixels and less colours. 

Pixel art will be defined as art made digitally using pixels, and brush art will be defined as art made using digital/physical brushes or renders. This is because art created with brushes usually contain a greater range of colours due to discrepancies within the amount of paint ratios in brushes compared to pixels that have manually set colours.

A list will be created of a number of all the different colours detected within an image. If there is more than a certain number of colours, the image will be marked as an advanced image that will most likely have used rendering/brushes to have been made rather than a simple image made out of pixels.
